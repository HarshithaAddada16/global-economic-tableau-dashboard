# 🌎 Global Economic Dashboard: How the World’s Largest Economies Responded to Global Events
## 💡 The Idea

What happens to the world’s biggest economies during major global events?

➡ ❓ How do GDP and trade trends respond?
➡ ❓ How does investment flow change?

This project shows these patterns through an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing the economic performance of the top five GDP nations:

✅ 🌎 United States
✅ 🌏 China
✅ 🇯🇵 Japan
✅ 🇩🇪 Germany
✅ 🇮🇳 India

Using real-world data from trusted sources, the dashboard highlights how these economies responded to events such as:
💥 2008 Financial Crisis
🦠 COVID-19 Pandemic

## 🎯 Objective: Turn economic data into a clear and interactive dashboard that is easy to explore and understand.

## 📊 What the Dashboard Shows

This dashboard combines key indicators to provide a snapshot of economic trends:

💰 GDP size and growth

📈 Inflation trends

⚖️ Trade surplus and deficit

🌍 Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows

It helps answer questions like:

➡ 🚀 How did GDP change during global events?
➡ 📦 Which countries had trade surpluses or deficits?
➡ 💹 How did foreign investment vary over time?

## 🔍 Core Visualizations
